The purpose of using NOPs in this context is often to create a pause or delay in the execution of the program at that specific point. This pause provides a space for external operations, such as reading data from a serial input.

So, the flow of your program would be:

Execute the code before the first NOP.
Pause at the first NOP (allowing for external operations).
Execute the code between the NOPs (your serial input subroutine).
Pause at the second NOP.
Continue with the code after the second NOP.
This allows you to insert custom functionality at the specified points in your program.

### README - Explanation of `collectDataFromFPGA` Function

#### Overview
This function is designed to collect serial data from an FPGA device connected to an Arduino through PORTC3. It incorporates basic error checking, including stop bit validation and introduces a delay after each received character.

#### Code Explanation

```c
// Function to collect serial data from FPGA
void collectDataFromFPGA(char* receivedData) {
```

- This function is responsible for receiving and processing serial data from the FPGA. It takes a character array (`receivedData`) as a parameter, where the collected data will be stored.

```c
    uint8_t dataIndex = 0;
    uint8_t rxd;
```

- Two variables are declared: `dataIndex` to keep track of the index in the `receivedData` array, and `rxd` to store the received character.

```c
    // Wait for the start of a new transmission on PORTC3
    while (PINC & (1 << PC3));
```

- This line initiates a wait loop, checking PORTC3 for a transition to log0 (start bit) indicating the beginning of a new transmission.

```c
    // Collect data until CRLF is received
    while (1) {
```

- Enters a continuous loop to collect data until a Carriage Return (CR) and Line Feed (LF) characters (CRLF) are received.

```c
        // Check for transition to log0 (start bit)
        while (PINC & (1 << PC3));
```

- Waits for the start of each bit (transition to log0) on PORTC3 before reading the UART data.

```c
        rxd = TTYr(); // Read UART from PORTC3
```

- Reads the UART data from PORTC3 and stores it in the `rxd` variable.

```c
        // Validate stop bit (assuming stop bit is expected to be high)
        if (PINC & (1 << PC3)) {
            // Invalid stop bit, handle the framing error as needed
            // For simplicity, you might want to discard the current character and continue
            continue;
        }
```

- Checks if the stop bit is high (validating it). If it's invalid, it handles a framing error. In this example, it discards the current character and continues with the next iteration.

```c
        // Check for end of transmission (CRLF)
        if (rxd == 0x0D) {
            // Null-terminate the received data
            receivedData[dataIndex] = '\0';
            break;
        }
```

- Checks if the received character is a Carriage Return (0x0D), indicating the end of transmission. If true, null-terminates the `receivedData` array and exits the loop.

```c
        // Store the received character
        receivedData[dataIndex] = rxd;
        dataIndex++;
```

- Stores the received character in the `receivedData` array and increments the `dataIndex` for the next character.

```c
        // Echo the received character to TTY
        TTYo(rxd);
```

- Echoes the received character back to the TTY (Teletype) for confirmation.


This function, therefore, represents a finite state machine that efficiently manages the process of collecting specific data from the FPGA in a non-blocking manner.In the context of the provided code, making the data collection from the FPGA non-blocking allows the main program to perform other tasks while waiting for the specific sequence of characters to arrive. The program can periodically check if the data has been successfully collected without waiting for it to finish. This approach is beneficial in systems where responsiveness and the ability to handle multiple tasks concurrently are important.

In ASCII, the uppercase letters 'A' to 'Z' have decimal values from 65 to 90, and the corresponding lowercase letters 'a' to 'z' have values from 97 to 122. The code checks if the received character (rxd) is in the lowercase range and, if so, performs a bitwise AND operation (&= 0xDF) to convert it to uppercase.

The decision to convert characters to uppercase might be driven by the assumption that the specific application or protocol expects uppercase characters. If the FPGA is sending data in uppercase, or if the case sensitivity of the received characters doesn't matter for the application, you can omit this conversion step.
